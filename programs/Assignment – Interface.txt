1)Why the below code is showing compile time error?
->Because interface methods must be implemented as public. 

2)Does below code compile successfully? If not, why?
->No, because interface fields are static and final by default and you canâ€™t change their value once they are initialized.
In the above code, methodB() is changing value of interface field A.

3)Is the following code written correctly?
->No, because interface can extend another interface,not the class.


4)What will be the output of the following program?
->QQQQPPPP
  PPPPQQQQ


5)Is the below program written correctly? If yes, what will be the output?
->Yes
Output:- 4


6] What is an interface in Java?
->An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java 
interface, not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method 
body.
Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship


7] Which modifiers are allowed for methods in an Interface?
->public,abstract


8] Suppose A is an interface. Can we create an object using new A()?
->No, we cannot create an object of interface using new operator.

9] Can an interface extends another interface in Java
->Yes
